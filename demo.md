Single Element in a Sorted Array 
---


Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. Find this single element that appears only once. 


Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2



Example 2:

Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10



Note:
Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

Coin Change 2 
---


You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.


Note: 
You can assume that

 0 <= amount <= 5000
 1 <= coin <= 5000
 the number of coins is less than 500 
 the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer



Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1


Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.


Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
